## Hi there, I'm Miguel 👋

21yo. I do code. Searching for fun in some huge codebases.

**At work:** mostly front-end, crafting products is a fun thing to do.
## 🔧 My tools
I was a Haskell guy for a while, so eventually I got the Monad Midas hand.

Nowadays, I enjoy using those languages:
- **typescript:** types pog
- **rust:** takes an eternity to build but it has a nice tooling and it works well with functional patterns.
